# NCCT-atlas-for-ASPECTS-scoring
This repository includes the age-specific non-contrast CT ASPECTS atlases across four age groups: 10-30 years, 30-50 years, 50-70 years, and 70-90 years constructed based on 281 NCCT images of healthy subjects from clinical practice. 

Keywords: Non-contrast computed tomography, ASPECTS regions, age-specific atlas. 

## Data provided 
* ASPECTS atlases
  * Average intensity brain (skull stripped)
  * ASPECTS regions (skull stripped) 
  
## Usage Notes 
The constructed age-specific ASPECTS atlases are a series of two-dimensional atlases corresponding to the level of the thalamus and basal ganglia and the rostral to ganglionic structures of different age groups. In the usage process, users need to manually select relevant NCCT image layers to map the ASPECTS regions and extract the brain tissue. These atlases not only can be used for rapid ASPECTS scoring, but the relevant neuroscience research.
